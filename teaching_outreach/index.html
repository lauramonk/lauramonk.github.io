			<h1>Teaching</h1>
			<p>During my PhD in the University of Strasbourg, I have been a teaching assistant and lecturer for a variety of years and subjets: <br>
			<ul>
				<li>Lectures in second year analysis.</li>
				<li>Marking and individual tutoring for the "agrégation", a teaching degree at the end of masters.</li>
				<li>Teaching assistant for 3rd year differential equations and 2nd year analysis.</li>
				<li>Oral exams for 1st and 2nd year of analysis and algebra.</li>
			</ul></p>
			<p>I also gave oral exams in preparatory school during three years, before my PhD.</p>
      			<h1>Outreach</h1>
			<p>The <a href="http://filles-et-maths.fr/rendez-vous-des-jeunes-mathematiciennes/">"Rendez-vous des Jeunes Mathématiciennes"</a> is an event 
			promoting mathematics toward high-school girls, organized by <a href="https://animath.fr/actions/">Animath</a> and <a href="http://www.femmes-et-maths.fr/">Femmes e Mathématiques</a>. 
			During three days, a group of 20-25 girls:
			<ul>
				<li>work on a research problem, under the supervision of PhD students, and present their results at the end of the stay</li>
				<li>meet individually with professional women in mathematics and science</li>
				<li>attend a few lectures by female mathematicians</li>
				<li>are educated about gender stereotypes in science and mathematics.</li>
			</ul></p>
			<p>The idea is for them to learn about careers in mathematics and science, meet some possible role models as well as other girls who love mathematics, 
			and have fun doing maths! <br>
			I first discovered this event in Paris, and then imported it in Strasbourg in 2018 and 2019.
